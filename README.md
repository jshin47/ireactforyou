## Justin Shin's image resizer tool for My Senior Center

This project was scaffolded via Yeoman React full stack.

Most of it is boilerplate junk but the reason I used it for this project was to demonstrate to the team that I am aware of basic frontend scaffolding tools and how to use them to get started and develop more quickly and (in my view more importantly) according to some kind of standard or practice.

Here is what I want to do in the next few days:

* By Tuesday morning - be prepared for Eric and team to evaluate the work by cloning the repository and installing and also by using an online demo I will set up. Features should include:
  * Image upload and reset
  * Resize via drag corner
  * Apply with arbitrary result or discard
  * If time permits, add the optional Props into the mix (constraints primarily)
  
* Beyond that I want to try to accomplish as many of these as I can by Thursday morning:
 
  * Crop
  * Pan
  * Zoom
  * Select
  * Filter
  * Paint
  * Select
  

Until Tuesday morning I would not expect very much from this page as I am working through the dragging/coordinate/slack/etc.
