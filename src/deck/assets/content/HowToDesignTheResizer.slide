So I want to show how to accomplish the basic task very easily, an image resizer.

I will do so in these 'slides' also programmed today for this very task.

The input files are '.slide' files and displaying slides is the first task to accomplish.

First, we will need a way to upload slides.

To get into the "admin" portion we'll require a sort of secret, a mouse movement that is unusual.
