I originally intended and came very close to succeeding at building a respectable base for a React-based image editor, something that you cannot find even online so easily.

I came within about 12 to 36 hours of doing so and then lost a lot of the work, and most of the desire to repeat it as it had been a lot tougher than I had imagined.

As a result I am embarssingly behind with this straightforward request because I got too greedy and confident.

So I will try to reassure you that I know how to do the basic task and that it could have been done far sooner had I stayed on track.
